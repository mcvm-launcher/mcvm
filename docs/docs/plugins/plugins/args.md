# Args
ID: `args`

The Args plugin is used to automatically add tuning arguments to your game in order to increase performance. 

## Usage
Use the `args_preset` field in the configuration for an instance or profile to choose a preset for the arguments to use. There are three options, `"aikars"`, `"krusic"`, and `"obydux"`. You can look up each of these presets online to see their explanations and use cases. Keep in mind that these arguments usually only work for servers with a lot of available memory, and you might not see an improvement at all.
